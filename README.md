#  **Overview**

Automatic SSH Tunnel is a Python script which can be used to create a Reverse SSH Tunnel between multiple computers running Linux and a centralized server.

Licensed under the MIT License - [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

### Features

- Automatically configures and runs openssh to set-up a reverse ssh connection during boot-up 

- Automatically generates ssh keys

- No need to store the server's password

- Works with Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu

- 3-step configuration wizard that requires less than 1 minute to set-up  


### System requirements

- These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 15.10, Ubuntu 14.04.3, and Raspbian Jessie (Raspberry Pi)

- The installation script automatically installs openssh-server with Apt

# **Getting started** 



### Download

Clone the latest repository version from Github (recommended):  
`$ git clone https://github.com/facerecog/auto-ssh-tunnel.git`  

Alternatively, download the .tar.gz  file from the top of this page and unpack it:  
`$ wget https://github.com/facerecog/auto-ssh-tunnel/tarball/master  -O - | tar -xz `  


Now `cd` into the newly extracted directory.


### Installation 

__*Additional instructions for Mac OS X Users*__

  *Go to:  
System Preferences > Sharing. Turn on "Remote Login". Allow access for "All Users".*
&nbsp;  

1. Run  configuration.py  to specify the port, username, and IP address of the SSH server:  
`$ ./configure.py <port_open> <port_forward> <username> <ip address>` 

2. Run the following command:  
`$ sudo ./setup.py install`  

The installation will proceed automatically. If successful, the output of all the commands should roughly show:

```

Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): Your identification has been saved in priv_key.

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
"<username>@<ip address>" 's password: 
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh ' "<username>@<ip address>" '"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

[*] Installing private keys inside protected folder...
[*] Moving autossh client into the /usr/local/bin/ directory...
[*] Moving private key to /etc/auto-ssh-tunnel/

[*] We are now finished with the installation! Restart the client to complete the installation. To run autossh, input connect.py on the terminal.
```  
-------------------------


# **How the script works**  

During installation, the script will automatically append the following lines to /etc/ssh/ssh_config:
```
ServerAliveInterval 30
ServerAliveCountMax 4
```
It will also append the following to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
ClientAliveInterval 30
ClientAliveCountMax 4
```

Upon boot, the client will run `connect.py`, which sets up a reverse ssh tunnel. The server may now ssh into the client even if the client resides behind a NAT firewall.

-------------------------

# **Verify that it works**  

* From the client, ssh into your server:  
`$ ssh <rootname>@<ip address>`  

* Once in, connect back to your client:  
`$ ssh <your username>@localhost -p <port number specified as above>`

* If successful, you have just ssh-ed back into your client. Congratulations and enjoy!
